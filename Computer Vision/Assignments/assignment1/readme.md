# Assignment 1 - Image sensing and digital image

Make sure you have python installed on your machine

The python version which was used in development is Python 3.9

Make sure you have installed packages that are required for this project

### To run the code from the terminal, change the directory to the root of the project and run:

`python3 main.py`

Tasks 3-6 are executed automatically and generated files are saved in a [Generated Assets](generatedAssets) directory, you can find the path to the generated file in terminal

For task 7 you will need to click on a photo for the process to start, it might take a while for the code to run, as soon as code finishes execution image will be closed and in terminal you can find the path of the generated file.

## Folder structure

[Assets](assets) folder contains photos from internet for testing purposes

[Assignment Photos](assignmentPhotos) folder contains photos that were taken by me for this assignment

[Generated Assets](generatedAssets) folder contains images that are generated by the code, this folder will include by default generated assets for some of the asset photos and assignment photos. If you run the code for the same file the files will simply be overwritten, but if you pick a new file, then the generated files will be added to this folder with the following naming convention:

`{fileName}-{taskDescription.jpg}`


## Code structure

All the code is in a single file - `main.py` which consists of two global variables for image path and the file name for that image followed by five functions one for each task in respective order. At the end od the code we have function calls.

## Code comments

Feel free to change imgPath to any photo on your computer, this is the only variable that needs to be changed for the execution of the code. I will have couple of ready options commented out to make the process easier

## Additional notes

As OpenCV doesn't support HEIC file format, which is the native format for Apple Smartphones, [Assignment Photos](assignmentPhotos) folder will have two files for each image, one in HEIC format, one in usual JPG format
