CORRESPONDENCE WITH PRINCE GEORGE'S LODGE, NO. 16, GEORGETOWN, S. C.,
APRIL, 1791.


WASHINGTON left Newbern, North Carolina, under an escort of horse, April
22, 1791, and arrived at Georgetown, South Carolina, by way of
Wilmington, N. C., Saturday, April 30, where he was received with a
salute of cannon, and by a company of infantry, and during the afternoon
was presented with the following address, by a Committee of Prince
George's Lodge, No. 16 (Moderns), of Georgetown, South Carolina.

This Lodge was one of the original six Lodges, which had been warranted
prior to 1756 in South Carolina, under the Jurisdiction of the
Provincial Grand Lodge, and through it, the Grand Lodge of England. It
is the only instance where a Lodge of the "Moderns" addressed Brother
WASHINGTON:

     "TO OUR ILLUSTRIOUS BROTHER GEORGE WASHINGTON.

     "_President of the United States._

     "At a time when all men are emulous to approach
     "you to express the lively sensations you inspire as
     "the Father of our country. Permit us the Brethren
     "of Prince George's Lodge No. 16 to have our share
     "in the general happiness in welcoming you to
     "Georgetown, and the pleasure of reflecting that we
     "behold in you the liberator of our country. the
     "distributor of its equal laws, and a Brother of our
     "most ancient and most honorable Order.

     "At the same time indulge us in congratulating
     "you on the truly honorable and happy situation in
     "which you now stand, as the Grand Conductor of
     "the political interests of these United States.

     "Having by your manly efforts caused the beau-
     "teous light of liberty to beam on this western hemi-
     "sphere, and by the wisdom Heaven has graciously
     "endowed you with established the liberties of
     "America on the justest and firmest basis that was
     "ever yet recorded in the annuals of history, you
     "now enjoy the supremest of all earthly happiness
     "that of diffusing peace, liberty, and safety to mil-
     "lions of your fellow-citizens.

     "As a true reward for your patriotic, noble and
     "exalted services we fervently pray the Grand Archi-
     "tect of the universe long to bless you with health,
     "stability, and power to continue you the Grand
     "Pillar of the arch of liberty in this vast empire,
     "which you have been so eminently distinguished in
     "raising to this pitch of perfection at which we now
     "behold it.

     "May the residue of your life be spent in ease
     "content and happiness, and as the Great Parent of
     "these United States may you long live to see your
     "children flourish under your happy auspices and
     "may you be finally rewarded with eternal happiness.

     "We conclude our present address with a fervent
     "wish that you will continue as you have hitherto
     "been, the friend of our ancient and honorable
     "Order, and of all worthy Masons.
