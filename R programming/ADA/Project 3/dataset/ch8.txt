CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF GEORGIA, MAY, 1791.


On the way from Charleston, South Carolina, to Savannah, Georgia,
WASHINGTON called on Mrs. Greene, the widow of late Brother General
Nathaniel Greene, at her plantation called Mulberry Grove, reaching
Savannah, Georgia, on the evening of Thursday, May 12, 1791.

Saturday, May 14, WASHINGTON was waited on by Brethren of the Grand
Lodge of Georgia and presented with the following address:[47]

     "TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

     "_Sir, and Brother_,

     "The Grand Master, Officers and Members of the
     "Grand Lodge of Georgia, beg leave to congratulate
     "you on your arrival in this city. Whilst your ex-
     "alted character claims the respect and deference of
     "all men, they from the benevolence of masonic prin-
     "ciples approach you with the familiar declaration
     "of fraternal affection.

     "Happy indeed that Society, renowned for its
     "antiquity, and pervading influence over the en-
     "lightened world, which having ranked a Frederick
     "at its head, can now boast of a Washington as a
     "Brother. A Brother who it justly hailed the Re-
     "deemer of his country, raised it to glory, and by his
     "conduct in public and private life has evinced to
     "Monarchs that true majesty consists not in splendid
     "royalty, but in intrinsic worth.

     "With these sentiments they rejoice at your pres-
     "ence in this State, and in common with their fellow-
     "citizens, greet you, thrice welcome, flattering them-
     "selves that your stay will be made agreeable.

     "May the great Architect of the Universe pre-
     "serve you whilst engaged in the work allotted you
     "on earth, and long continue you the brightest pil-
     "lar of our Temple, and when the supreme fiat shall
     "summon you hence, they pray the might I AM
     "may take you into his holy keeping,

        "Grand Lodge in Savannah
          "May 14th 5791.
            "GEO: HOUSTON,
              "_Grand Master_."
